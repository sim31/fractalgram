# Fractalgram

Telegram web client tailored for participants of [Eden](https://www.edenelections.com/) / [fractally](https://fractally.com/) style DAOs.

This is a fork of [Telegram Web Z](https://github.com/Ajaxy/telegram-tt), which adds some additional features to help run [Eden](https://www.edenelections.com/) / [Fractally](https://fractally.com/) style meetings. Specifically it adds some buttons to automate creation of polls and other kinds of messages which help reach consensus in these meetings.
